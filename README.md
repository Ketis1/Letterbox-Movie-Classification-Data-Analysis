# 🎬 Letterboxd Movie Classification & Analysis
This project explores and classifies movies based on user ratings and metadata collected from the Letterboxd movie platform. It focuses on analyzing viewer behavior, exploring genre trends, and building a machine learning model to predict whether a movie will be rated highly or not.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Letterboxd movie data.

- Clean and preprocess metadata and ratings for classification.

- Use machine learning models to predict whether a movie is "liked" (e.g., average rating ≥ 3.5).

- Visualize relationships between movie attributes (genres, release year, etc.) and user ratings.
